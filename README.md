## TensorFlow Deep Learning Journey
Welcome to my comprehensive exploration of TensorFlow! This repository documents my journey in deep learning, containing practical examples, tutorials, and projects showcasing various aspects of TensorFlow, from basics to advanced applications.

# Repository Structure
This repository is organized into several key sections, each representing a significant step in my learning and project development process:

# Notebooks
00_tensorflow_fundamentals.ipynb: Introduction to TensorFlow fundamentals.
01_neural_network_regression_with_tensorflow.ipynb: Neural network regression with TensorFlow.
02_neural_network_classification_with_tensorflow.ipynb: Neural network classification with TensorFlow.

# Models
best_model_SaveModel_format: Contains the best model saved in the TensorFlow SavedModel format.

best_model_2_HDF5_format.h5: Contains the best model saved in the HDF5 format.

best_model_2_SavedModel.keras: Contains the best model saved in the Keras SavedModel format.

# Usage
Each notebook contains detailed explanations and code snippets that you can run and modify to better understand how TensorFlow works. The models provided can be loaded and used for further training or inference.
